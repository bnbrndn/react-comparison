## About

This Application was built using React. Images/Data regarding the shoes are stored in shoes.js amd imported into app.js

Bootstrap is added into the project via NPM and included in the scss, the breakpoints have been imported also to make media queries easier to write.

The naming convention used is BEM.

Each filter has its own function to filter through the determined data. This could be set to anything, allowing for expansion of the project to be able to filter by other attributes.

The green bars are managed by an array which is filled depending on the value entered in shoes.js
